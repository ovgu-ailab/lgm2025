# Reading Assignment 4: Generative Adversarial Networks

## Main Reading

Please read Chapter 17 of the [Bishop Book](https://www.bishopbook.com/).
This is light on theory and relatively short.

## Further Alternative Reading

If you want a more theoretically involved treatment of GANs, Chapter 26 of [Murphy's Book on Machine Learning (Part 2)](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html) will serve you well.

For examples of early GAN research, there is [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661), or [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434) which was the first successfull application of CNNs to the GAN framework.
