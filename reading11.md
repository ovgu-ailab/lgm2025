# Reading Assignment 11: (Stochastic) Differential Equations

We have prepared [a blog post](https://ovgu-ailab.github.io/blog/methods/2026/01/07/sdes-odes.html) for you that gives a basic introduction to the next topic.
**At the bare minimum**, you must understand differential equation basics, as we will not devote time to this in class, beyond answering any open questions, of course.
The remainder of the article gives a relatively high-level view of the specific topics we will treat in more detail in the lecture.
We also provide links to original papers throughout, in case you want more details.

Note: There is a slight chance that some of the later sections (Flow Matching, Consistency Models) will be updated throughout the week.
In case you do the reading early, consider checking back again later to see if there have been any updates.
